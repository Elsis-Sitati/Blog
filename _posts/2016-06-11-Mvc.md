title: Understanding MVC

MVC is an acronym for Model View Controller.This is a software development methodology where a software is dissected into three
parts;the Model,the Views and Controllers.The model part is the logic of an application.It contains data and the various methods 
manipulating this data.The View component is the part of the system that a user interacts with ie the User Interface.It presents 
data and information to a screen,and also specifies how this data or information will be presented.The Controller is like a 
bridge between the Models and the Views.It handles the communication between the Models and the views.The MVC architecture is
not so quite new,it was developed in 1979.

When you for example want to see your status update on facebook,your browser sends a request to th server.The server then goes
into the database and says "hey...i am looking for updates.what do you have for me?" The database finds the updates and sends 
the request back to the server.The server then processes  this information one last time.It creates a page with html and css,puts
relevant information to it and sends it back to the browser.The client browser then processes it and renders it to a screen where 
you can now view it.Now in relation to this,the view is the client,the model is the database and the controller is the server.
So if you are writing code that is related to the database,it goes in the models.If you are writing code that is processing 
information to or from the database, or before it gets to the view,that code goes to the Controller.Any front end stuff that the
browser displays is placed in the view.

In summary,anything that adds  data to a database or retrieves data from the database is placed in the models.The view is what
is displaying information to the user.The controller handles all the server side logic.It handles all requests.
