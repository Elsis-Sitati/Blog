title: How to Use Github in Android Studio
---

Version control is very important in software development.I personally use GIT where i commit my changes to my local machineand later on push them online to github.Android Studio saves us the hustle of typing command line instructions and we can therefore make our version control directly from the IDE without necessarily going to the terminal.I am going to show you how.

1.Go to the menu bar and find the VCS option

2.Click the VCS option.A drop down menu will appear.Go to the option that says "import into version control"

3.Another drop down menu will appear.Select the option that says "share project on github".Incase you are doing this for 
the first time android studio will prompt you to register your github username with it together with your password.You should
go ahead and fill the necessarily details.Thereafter you will only be required to enter your password whenever you want to 
create a new project on github from android studio.

4.Android Studio will prompt you to give your repo a name together with a description.

5.Click the share button once this is done.Consequenly select the files you want tobe included in your first commit.Once
you click okay your repository will be created online on github.

6.You will notice that there is now a green arrow and a blue arrow on the menu bar.select the green arrow whenever you
want to make a commit.Type your commit message and press the commit button.

7. Whenever you want to push your code to your online github,go to the menu bar and select VCS.A drop down menu will appear
select the GIT option.

8.Another drop drowm menu will appear.select push and specify what branch you want the code to be pushed to
