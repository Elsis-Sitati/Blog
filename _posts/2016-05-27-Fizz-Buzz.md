title: FizzBuzz in JavaScript and Python
---

I have come to find out that FizzBuzz is a common test for many coding interviews.I recenty was asked to write a FizzBuzz code
in an interview i was taking and therefore i though i should write something about it.The most important thing is to get the 
logic.Once the logic is rigth it can be implemented in any programming Language.Here are my steps for solving FizzBuzz
1 Declare a loop that loops from 1 to 100

2 Have the loop check if the number is both divisible by both 3 and 5 and rhen return "FizzBuzz"

3 Have the loop check if a number is divisible by 3 and return "Fizz"

4 Have the loop check if a number is divisible by 5 and return "Buzz"

5 The loop should return the number if none of the above conditions have been met

### JavaScript Code

     fizzBuzz(){

        for(var i=1;i<=100;i++){
	        if(i%5 === 0 && i%3 === 0){
			print('FizzBuzz');
		} else if(i%3 === 0){
			print('Fizz');
		} else if(i%5 === 0){
			print('Buzz');
		} else {
			print(i);
		}
	}
}
