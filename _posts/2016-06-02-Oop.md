title: Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming
---

Object Oriented programming is a type of programming in which you model your program/code around data sturctures called 
objects.Objects are usually implementation or instances of classes and they therefore they have properties and methods.
Properties are the attributes of a class while methods are the behaviour ie the functionality part .I am going to briefly 
talk about the four fundaments of object oriented programming which is ### inheritance, ### encapsuation, ### abstraction 
and ### polymorphism
