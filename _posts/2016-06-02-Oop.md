title: Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming
---

Object Oriented programming is a type of programming in which you model your program/code around data sturctures called 
objects.Objects are usually implementation or instances of classes and they therefore they have properties and methods.
Properties are the attributes of a class while methods are the behaviour ie the functionality part .I am going to briefly 
talk about the four fundaments of object oriented programming which is inheritance, encapsuation, abstraction 
and polymorphism

### Encapsulation
Encapsuation simply means data hiding.i.e. preventing access to data by any means other than those specified. 
Encapsulation defines the access levels for elements of that class. These access levels define the access rights to the data, allowing us to access the data by a method of that particular class itself, from an inheritance class, or even from any other class. There are three levels of access:

public: functions of all classes may access the data or methods of a class that is defined with the public access level. This is the lowest level of data protection

protected: data access is restricted to functions of inheritance classes, i.e. member functions of that class and all sub-classes

private: data access is restricted to methods of that particular class only. This is the highest level of data protection
